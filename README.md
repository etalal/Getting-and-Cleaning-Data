# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

## Introduction

This project is a part of getting and cleaning data course on Coursera provided by Johns Hopkins University.The purpose of the project is to demonstarte the ability to collect, work with and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis.Following items were required for a sucessful submission-
* a tidy dataset
* a link to a Github repository with the script for performing the analysis
* a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md

## Data Source

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
